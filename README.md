**String Calculator TDD Kata**

- Description : 
This repository contains a simple String Calculator built using React and following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The project implements a calculator that takes a string of numbers separated by delimiters (such as commas, newlines, or custom delimiters) and returns the sum of those numbers. It also handles specific scenarios like negative numbers and large numbers (greater than 1000), along with multiple delimiters.

- Features : 
Add numbers from a string separated by commas, newlines, or custom delimiters.
Handle negative numbers by throwing an exception.
Ignore numbers greater than 1000.
Support multiple custom delimiters.
